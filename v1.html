         <p>‚ÄúHey folks, this is my first ever blog for 19 years. I would
like to introduce myself before jumping into the topic. First of all, I&#39;m
a defense aspirant, second of all, I&#39;m an athlete. So I believe I know
much about defense. Hope I get enough support.‚Äù</p>
        <p>People here must be wondering how great our army (Indian army) is.
Well, I have an answer. I&#39;m just stating one of the few wars which
India fought because this one is special. This war carried India to
victory, Pak&#39;s surrender, and the birth of a new country. So let‚Äôs start.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-center"> <em>‚ÄúYOU SURRENDER OR WE WIPE YOU OUT‚Äù</em> </p>
<p class="text-right">-Sam Manekshaw to Pakistan <br> on
13 th Dec 1971 during the <br> Indo-Pak
war.</p>

<p>India‚Äôs greatest military commander Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.
The most Badass Army General ever! Remember, there are only two
persons who have reached the ‚ÄúFIELD MARSHAL‚Äù rank.</p>
<p>Dec 16 is a significant day for India and its neighbours Bangladesh
and Pakistan. In 1971, India won the war against Pakistan that
resulted in the birth of Bangladesh (East Pakistan). Pakistan lost half
of its country, its forces in the east and had to publicly surrender to
India.</p>
<p>It was also the largest military surrender after World War II. The
estimated count is 93,000 Pakistan soldiers along with their General
Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi.</p>
<p>So, the war started when Pakistan launched airstrikes on 11 Indian
airbases. India quickly responded to Pak army&#39;s movements in the
west and captured around 15,010 km of Pakistan&#39;s territory. This was
perhaps the first time in which all 3 forces of India fought in unison.</p>
<p>(India never starts a war unless and until they‚Äôre forced to do so, this
is a record which India holds till date)</p>
<p>The conflict was a result of the Bangladesh Liberation war when
Bangladesh (then East Pak) was fighting for freedom from West
Pakistan. In 1971, Pak army began to commit the barbaric genocide
on the innocent Bengali population, particularly the minority Hindu
population in East.</p>
<p>Rape, torture, killings, and conflicts followed due to which eight to
ten million people fled the country to seek refuge in India. Between
3,00,000 to 30,00,000 civilians were killed in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had to
launch a full-scale war against Pakistan. India was already facing the
burden of the continuous flow of refugees from East Pakistan. She
also appealed world leaders to intervene and pressurize Pakistan to
stop its brutalities but India did not have much time and response
became necessary.</p>
<p>She ordered Army Chief General Sam Manekshaw to launch an
offensive against Pakistan. And yeah that was the end of Pakistan.
The Indian Army brought the Pakistani army to its knees, took 93,000
Pakistani prisoners, and gave 75 million people of Bangladesh their
independence.</p>

<p>Over 3,800 soldiers of India and Pakistan lost their lives in this war.
The war lasted for just 13 days and is one of the shortest wars in
history.</p>
<p>On August 2, 1972, India and Pakistan signed the Shimla Agreement
under which the former agreed to release all the 93,000 Pakistani
prisoners of war.</p>

<h6> <strong>Conclusion:</strong> </h6>
<p>India remains silent, but when provoked they can never be stopped.
May God bless the opposition! I hear people complain about India
and its society but they must never forget that there are lots of
people losing their lives every single day to protect this country. I
hope that now everyone knows how badass the Indian Army is.</p>
