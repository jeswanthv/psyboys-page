        <p>As a student I was also confused on what to learn after wasting my whole freshman year watching TV Series,Movies and Anime.I am Not Kidding .I have watched like 20-25 Tv Series‚Äôs from Sitcom to Sci-fi like 5-10 Seasons minimum each .Any Famous Tv Series ,You name it I would have watched.I applied for an internship in a NIT and Due to lack of applicants I got selected . So I thought I have to take my career Seriously. Were My friends were creating Cool Stuff with ML and Webdesign . I had interest in both but never stared learning.It was time to Start learning .</p>
        <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/bc1b3ab8289d2e60843e9823ee90f412/tenor.gif?itemid=8019684" width="280px">
        <p>I was puzzled where to start .So I completed Python up to like numpy and Pandas.I Wasn‚Äôt satisfied so started with R and later JS. I loved all these languages .But , I was having a emotional situation .I was raised in a poor family and I feel inferior whenever I see people wasting money like water .Because of It I wasted a lot of time just thinking about it,speaking to friends about it .The worst part ,I was not able go any where out side(Thanks to COVID-19). I wasted like 2 Weeks just on this thing then realized all the people in my linked-in are utilizing their useful .I started feeling depressed ,choked in sadness and going back to how I was In my freshman‚Äôs year.I wanted to get Out of it .</p>
        <p>So I started working on a simple beginner level project which Dragged me into the small intersection world of Dev-ops and Data Science.I started getting Confidence on myself that I can also achieve like my cool Seniors in my School.But it was only the project which dragged me out my Addicted world in which I was feeling inferior to all.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned to know what it was ,So that normal Students like you and me can Also achieve something meaningful in our life.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúLife is not fair, but it is worth living :)‚Äù</p>
