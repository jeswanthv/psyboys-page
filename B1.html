        <h4 class="my-3"> <strong>PERFECT GUIDE TO CHOOSE A BIKE </strong> </h4>

         <p>In a large two wheeler market like India where there are plenty of bikes to choose from one can easily be mislead to choose a wrong bike, if motorcycles are treated only as a go to machine it will not matter a lot but motorcycles are now being enjoyed, a rider can blush every mile he clocks on his motorcycle. Choosing a bike is not always easy  one has to decide three main factors which will ultimately  lead to the perfect bike.</p>
        <h6> <strong>1.BUDGET</strong> </h6>
        <h6> <strong>2.USAGE</strong> </h6>
        <h6> <strong>3.MAINTENANCE COST</strong> </h6>
        <p>Apart from these go with your mind</p>
        <h6> <strong>1.BUDGET  :</strong>  </h6>
        <p>The first thing to decide is your budget .Buying bikes will mostly be a one time investment and a dream so pushing your boundaries a little further will not disappoint u in the future.At the same time know your limits. In case if you are planning to get your bike in installments do not spend more than 70% of your salary in it because u also have the maintenance of the bike,this is were most of buyers go wrong they will have the bike but will not be able to ride it so plan wisely.Fixing a budget will not be too hard but it is primary.</p>
        <h6> <strong>2.USAGE :</strong> </h6>
        <p>Another major factor is what we are going to do with our ride.If you are a kind of person who wishes to cover all the roads in the country and if you tend to get a supersport then it wont turn good stated that it can happen but the experience u gain will be worst.what i mean is covering 1000km in a single day on a BMW1250GS is a space ground differnt from covering the same in a s1000rr,at the same time a 1250GS will not be exciting as a s1000rr in track.Spending lakhs on a bike we expect it to be versatile ,we expect it to be excellent in onroad,offroad and on noroads but anyday this is not going to happen. So prioritizing what you need is very much important.</p>
        <h6> <strong>3.MAINTENANCE COST :</strong> </h6>
        <p>Apart from buying the bike by just seeing its price tag one has has to know whether he/she will be able to maintain that particular motorcycle by servicing it properly and availability of the spares also must be made sure.One can easily get a get a 6 year old liter class bike for a sum of 9 lakhs  ,but after getting the bike every general service for it will definitely will be around INR15000 and the tires wont last more than 8k km set of tires will cost  minimum of INR30000 apart from these there are spares. All these must be considered before getting a bike .If you are a person who wishes to restore a vintage bike like yezdi or any other bikes dont put your hands in it without having having a fluid budget.
