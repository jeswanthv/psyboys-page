        <img src="https://images2.alphacoders.com/910/thumb-1920-910503.jpg" width="280px">
         <p>Back in my childhood days, my mom used to send me to my cousin's house. I would have a really great time there happily playing around all day with my cousin and his friends. I donno how time passes by but when finally night comes, then I'll realize that I really miss my mom. During morning time even though she calls me, I don't have anything to speak to her. I won't speak much to her, but when night comes I really miss my mom and i will be filled with tears. But this will be there only for a short period of time. Later, I learnt to over come this situation. I used to take my mom's cloth along with me where I get my mom's smell which made me feel comfortable.</p>
        <p>After, when I grew up, I started liking to be alone. I used to go to my cousin's house even without my mom and started being without missing her. When I reached my teenage I started be separate from my parents. I don't like much mingling with them. They used to scold me and I started hating that. Even though my mom used to show the same love, even though everything is same, my parents expected more from me in sense of maturity and academics. I thought I had enough for me but it was not upto my parents expectations. Slowly I started to get separate from them. During this time I got many friends whome I never thought will be there even after many years. Later life changed on, I completed my school not with a decent score but I tried my best. Somehow I got my college in counseling.</p>

        <p>But now, I really miss someone truly in this quarantine. I never knew that I will miss someone so much and love someone so much. Though my mom cared for me, her caring was special to me. Though my mom is been on my side all time, presence of her was special to me. Day by day I started missing her so much. This quarantine thought me that how much I love her. Day by day I became worse than the before. I started missing her so much. I donno how the morning passes since I wake up late, but when night comes, I realize that I really miss my her. During morning time even though she calls me, I don't have anything to speak to her. I won't speak much to her, but when night comes I really miss her so much and i will be filled with tears. But this time I donno when I will meet her again. This time I don't even have her clothes to get her smell .I don't feel like eating anything even when I feel hungry. During night, instead of dreams, my mind will be filled with her thoughts and memories that she gave me. This took all my sleep. Though I smile, my smile was not that happy. Even when someone facing my situation, they won't understand how bad I feel and how badly I miss her. I hope this quarantine comes to an end.
